<p>Now we want to know what Player 1's payoff will be as she varies the probability, \(p\text{,}\) with which she plays \(B\text{.}\) We can draw a graph where the \(x\)-axis represents to probability with which she plays B (\(p\)) and the \(y\)-axis represents the expected payoff (\(m\)). Thus, when Player 1 plays only \(A\text{,}\) she is playing \(B\) with probability 0; when Player 1 plays only B, she is playing B with probability 1. It might be easier to remember if you label your graph as in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_MixedStrategyAxes.html" title="Figure 3.2.3">FigureÂ 3.2.3</a>.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_solvingeq.html#li-124">in-context</a></span>
