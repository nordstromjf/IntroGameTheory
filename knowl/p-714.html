<p>Both Prisoner's Dilemma and Chicken are models of games where we describe the choice of strategy as “Cooperate” and “Defect”. In Prisoner's Dilemma, we think of “cooperating” as cooperating with the other player, and “defecting” as turning against the other player. So if both players cooperate (with each other, not the police), they will get the higher payoff of only one year in prison. They defect by ratting on each other. In Chicken, players cooperate by swerving and defect by driving straight. Using the examples of Prisoner's Dilemma and Chicken, think about how these games can model other everyday interactions where you could describe your choices as cooperating and defecting. The remainder of the chapter looks more closely at situations where players can cooperate or defect.</p>
