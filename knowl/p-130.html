<p>For now, we can use a “guess and check” method for finding equilibrium pairs. Take each outcome and decide whether either player would prefer to switch. Remember, Player 1 can only choose a different row, and Player 2 can only choose a different column. In our above example there are four outcomes to check: {A, X}, {A, Y}, {B, X}, and {B, Y}. We already know {B, Y} is an equilibrium pair, but let's check the rest. Suppose the players play {A, X}. Does Player 1 want to switch to B? No, she'd rather get 100 than 0. Does player 2 want to switch to Y? Yes! She'd rather get 10 than -100. So {A, X} is NOT an equilibrium pair since a player wants to switch. Now check that for {A, Y} Player 1 would want to switch, and for {B, X} both players would want to switch. Thus {A, Y} and {B, X} are NOT equilibrium pairs. Now you can try to find equilibrium pairs in any matrix game by just checking each payoff vector to see if one of the players would have wanted to switch to a different strategy.</p>
