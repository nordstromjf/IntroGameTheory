<p>See if you can determine how often Player 1 should play each row, and how often Player 2 should play each column. Try testing your proposed strategy (you may be able to use a variation on the dice as we saw in <a knowl="./knowl/E_RPSdice.html" title="Exercise 3.1.16: Testing the Random(1/3, 1/3, 1/3) strategy">ExerciseÂ 3.1.16</a>).
