<p>Let us note some characteristics of Tic Tac Toe. </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li><p>There are two players.</p></li>
<li><p>Players have <em class="emphasis">perfect information</em>. This means each player knows what all of his or her own options are, what all of his or her opponent's options are, and both players know what the outcome of each option is. Additionally, players know that both players have all of this information.</p></li>
<li><p>This game has a <em class="emphasis">solution</em>.  A solution for a game consists of a strategy for each player and the outcome of the game when each player plays his or her strategy. In Tic Tac Toe, if both players play their best, the game will always end in a tie.</p></li>
<li><p>The game is <em class="emphasis">finite</em>. This means the game must end after a finite number of moves of turns. In other words, the game cannot go on forever. A game that is not finite is called <em class="emphasis">infinite</em>. Note, an infinite game may end after a finite number of turns, but there is no maximum number of turns or process to ensure the game ends. In Tic Tac Toe, the game must end after 9 or fewer turns.</p></li>
