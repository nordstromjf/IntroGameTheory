</h6>
<p>One example of a Volunteer's Dilemma is the game where everyone chooses “1 point” or “5 points.” If at least one person writes down 1 point, then everyone gets the number of points they wrote down. If no one chooses 1 point, then everyone gets 0 points. Choosing “1 point” is considered volunteering or cooperating. Choosing to not volunteer and take “5 points” is defecting.</p>
<p>You should note that it is difficult to put this game into a matrix form since payoffs depend on whether there is at least one volunteer or cooperator.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_VolunteerDil.html#E_VDpoints">in-context</a></span>
