<p>Since Player 1 must say “ace” when dealt an ace, he only has a choice of strategy when dealt a king. So we can define his strategy independent of the deal. One strategy is to say “ace” when dealt an ace and say “ace” when dealt a king; call this the <dfn class="terminology">bluffing strategy</dfn> (B). The other strategy is to say “ace” when dealt an ace and say “king” when dealt a king; call this the <dfn class="terminology">truth strategy</dfn> (T). Recall that the only time Player 2 has a choice is when Player 1 says “ace.” In this case Player 2 can <em class="emphasis">call</em> (C) or <em class="emphasis">fold</em> (F). Since we need to determine the payoff matrix, we first need to determine the payoffs for pure strategies. This is similar to what we did for the One-Card Stud game.</p>
