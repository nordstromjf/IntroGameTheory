<p>We've seen how to describe a zero-sum game and how to find equilibrium pairs. We've tried to decide what each player's strategy should be. Each player may need to consider the strategy of the other player in order to determine his or her best strategy. But we need to be careful, although our intuition can be useful in deciding the best strategy, we'd like to be able to be more precise about finding strategies for each player. We'll learn some of these tools in the next section.</p>
