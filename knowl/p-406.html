<p>Determine Player 1's maximin mixed strategy. Recalling that the first coordinate is \(p\text{,}\) the probability that Player 1 plays <em class="emphasis">B</em>, we know that Player 1 will play B with probability 1/4, and thus, play A with probability 3/4 [\(1-1/4=3/4\)]. The expected payoff for Player 1 is 1/2. It is important to check back to your original intuition about the game from <a knowl="./knowl/E_linearconjecture.html" knowl-id="xref-E_linearconjecture" alt="Exercise 3.2.2 " title="Exercise 3.2.2 ">ExerciseÂ 3.2.2</a>. Did it seem as though Player 1 should play A more often than B?</p>
