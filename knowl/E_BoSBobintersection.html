</h6>
<p>The area between the two lines still represents the possible expected values for Bob, depending on how often Alice plays each of her strategies. So as before, the bottom lines represent the <em class="emphasis">least</em> Bob can expect as he varies his strategy. Thus, the point of intersection will represent the biggest of these smallest values (the maximin strategy). Find this point of intersection. How often should Bob play each option? What is his expected payoff?</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="Intrononzero.html#E_BoSBobintersection">in-context</a></span>
