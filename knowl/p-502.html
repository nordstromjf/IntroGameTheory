<p>We could use our previous graphical method to determine the expected value of the game (you might quickly try this just to verify your prediction). However, as we have noted, a major drawback of the graphical solution is that if our players have 3 (or more) options, then we would need to graph an equation in 3 (or more!) variables; which, I hope you agree, we don't want to do. Although we will continue to focus on \(2 \times 2\) games, we will develop a new method which can more easily be used to solve to larger games.</p>
