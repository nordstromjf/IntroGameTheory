<p>One of the significant drawbacks of the graphical solution from the previous sections is that it can only solve 2 X 2 matrix games. If each player has 3 options, we would need to graph in three dimensions. Technically this is possible, but rather complicated. If each player has more than 3 options, since we can't graph in four or more dimensions, we are at a complete loss. So we need to think about an alternate way to solve for the mixed strategies. Although we will begin with 2 X 2 games, this method will easily generalize to larger games.</p>
