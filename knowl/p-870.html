<p>The TIT-FOR-TAT strategy is particularly interesting in an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. It has a few special characteristics that lead to success. First it is <em class="emphasis">responsive</em> in that it responds to the strategy of the other player. If the other player is cooperating, the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy will be able to gain the 3 points on each round. If the other player is defecting, it will defect so as to not keep getting the sucker's payoff of 0. The random strategies and pure strategies, for example, are not responsive. They do not respond to how the other player is playing. Chances are when you played in the tournament, you wanted to be able to adapt your strategy to respond to how your opponent was playing.</p>
