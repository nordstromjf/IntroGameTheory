<span class="type">Exercise</span> <span class="codenumber">3.4.6</span> <span class="title">The \((60, 40)\) strategy for Player 2</span>
</h6>
<p>Suppose Player 2 plays H 60% of the time and T 40% of the time. </p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>What are \(P_2(H)\) and \(P_2(T)\text{?}\)</p></li>
<li><p>What do you think Player 1 should do? Does this differ from your ideal mixed strategy in <a knowl="./knowl/E_mpguess.html" title="Exercise 3.4.4: Conjecture a mixed strategy">ExerciseÂ 3.4.4</a>? Explain.</p></li>
<li><p>We can use expected value to compute what Player 1 should do in response to Player 2's 60/40 strategy. First, consider a pure strategy for Player 1. Compute the expected value for Player 1 if she only plays H while Player 2 plays H with probability .6  and T with probability .4. This expected value is \(E_1(H)\text{,}\) above.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, compute the expected value for Player 1 if she plays only T (call it \(E_1(T)\)).</p></li>
<li><p>Which pure strategy has a higher expected value for Player 1? If Player 1 plays this pure strategy, will she do better than your predicted value of the game?</p></li>
