<p>Thus, if the game has an equilibrium we know that players will play the pure strategies determined by the equilibrium pairs. So let's get back to thinking about games without equilibrium pairs. If we play such a game once, can we predict the outcome? What about if we repeat the game several times– can we predict the outcome? Think about tossing a coin. If you toss it once, can you predict the outcome? What if you toss it 100 times– can you predict the outcome? Not exactly, but we can say what we <em class="emphasis">expect</em>: if we toss a coin 100 times we expect to have half of the coins turn up heads and half turn up tails. This may not be the <em class="emphasis">actual</em> outcome, but it is a reasonable prediction. Now is a good time to remind yourself about finding the <em class="emphasis">expected value</em>!!</p>
