<p>Now suppose, Player 1 plays the (1/3, 2/3) strategy. Then the expected payoff to Player 2 for playing pure strategy C, \(E_2(C)\text{,}\) is 20/3; and the expected payoff to Player 2 for playing pure strategy D, \(E_2(D)\text{,}\) is 5/3. Thus Player 2 prefers C over D. But if Player 2 plays only C, then Player 1 should abandon her (1/3, 2/3) strategy and just play B! This results in the payoff vector (5, 10). Notice, that now the expected value for Player 1 is 5, which is better than 10/3! Again, since Player 2 is not trying to keep Player 1 from gaining, there is no reason to apply the maximin strategy to non-zero-sum games. Similarly, we don't want to apply the expected value solution since Player 1 does not care if Player 2's expected values are equal. Each player only cares about his or her own payoff, not the payoff of the other player.</p>
