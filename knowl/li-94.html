<p>Now we want to know what Player 1's payoff will be as she varies the probability, \(p\text{,}\) with which she plays <em class="emphasis">B</em>. We can draw a graph where the \(x\)-axis represents to probability with which she plays B (\(p\)) and the \(y\)-axis represents the expected payoff (\(m\)). See <a knowl="./knowl/F_MixedStrategyAxes.html" title="Figure 3.2.3">Figure 3.2.3</a>. <figure class="figure-like"><img src="images/image-7.svg" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt=""><figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span> <span class="codenumber">3.2.3</span> Labeled axes.</figcaption></figure> Thus, when Player 1 plays only A, she is playing B with probability 0; when Player 1 plays only B, she is playing B with probability 1. It might be easier to remember if you label your graph as in <a knowl="./knowl/F_MixedStrategyAxes.html" title="Figure 3.2.3">Figure 3.2.3</a>.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_MixStratGraph.html#li-94">in-context</a></span>
