<p>Find the probability (\(p\)) and payoff (\(m\)) if Player 1 always plays <em class="emphasis">A</em>. If Player 1 plays pure strategy A, then she never plays B. Thus the probability she plays B is 0. Hence,  \(p=0\text{.}\) In the case where Player 1 plays A and Player 2 plays C, what is the payoff to Player 1? This is \(m\text{,}\) so \(m=1\text{.}\) Thus, for the strategy pair \([A, C]\) we get \((0, 1)\) for \((p, m)\text{.}\) It is important to note that \((0, 1)\) is <em class="emphasis">not</em> a payoff vector. This is common notation for any ordered pair. With payoff vectors, the ordered pair represents the payoff to each player. Here the ordered pair represents a probability of playing B and the payoff to Player 1.</p>
