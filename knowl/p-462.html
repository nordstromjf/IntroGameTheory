<p>Before moving on, let's again, make sure we understand what this line represents. Any point on it represents the expected payoff to Player 1 as she varies her strategy, <em class="emphasis">assuming Player 2 only plays \(C\)</em>. In this case, we can see that as she plays \(B\) more often, her expected payoff goes down. You can now use this Sage cell to plot any line for Player 2's pure strategy \(C\text{.}\) Just edit the values for the points \(u\) and \(v\text{.}\) Go ahead and try it! (Don't worry the original values will reset when you refresh the page.)</p>
