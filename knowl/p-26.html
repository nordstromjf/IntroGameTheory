<p>It is important to recognize the difference between having the goal of maximizing the payoff and having the goal of simply winning. Here are some examples. </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li><p>If two players were racing, a player wouldn't just want to finish first, she would want to finish by as large a margin as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>If two teams were playing basketball, the team wouldn't want to just have the higher score, they would want to win by the largest number of points. In other words, a team would prefer to win by 10 points rather than by 1 point.</p></li>
<li><p>In an election poll, a candidate doesn't just want to be ahead of her opponent, she wants lead by as large a margin as possible, (especially if she needs to account for error in the polls).</p></li>
</ol>
