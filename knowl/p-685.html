<p>If we apply the graphical method for Player 1 to the above game, we get that Player 1 should play a (1/3, 2/3) mixed strategy for an expected payoff of 10/3. Similarly we can determine that Player 2 should play a (2/3, 1/3) mixed strategy for an expected payoff of 10/3. Recall we developed this strategy as a “super defensive” strategy. But are our players motivated to play as defensively in a non-zero-sum game? Not necessarily! It is no longer true that Player 2 needs to keep Player 1 from gaining!</p>
