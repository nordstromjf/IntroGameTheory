<p>We have seen that we can use the same matrix with Player 1's payoffs to find the strategy for Player 2. Using the same game matrix as above:</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\left[\begin{matrix}1\amp 0\\
-1\amp 2
\end{matrix} \right],
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>and continuing to label Player 1's strategies by \(A\) and \(B\text{,}\) and Player 2's strategies by \(C\) and \(D\text{,}\) we can graph lines for Player 1's pure strategies \(A\) and \(B\text{.}\) We now let the \(x\)--axis represent the probability that Player 2 plays \(D\text{.}\) In the Sage applet below, for \(u\) and \(v\) enter the coordinates of two points that determine the line for when Player 1 plays \(A\text{,}\) then the two points for \(w\) and \(z\) that determine the line for when Player 1 plays \(B\text{.}\) We will then have Sage graph the lines. You can enter new values for \(u, v, w, z\) if you would like to draw the graph for a different matrix.</p>
