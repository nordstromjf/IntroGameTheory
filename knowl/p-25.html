<p>A player's <em class="emphasis">payoff</em> is the amount (points, money, or anything a player values) a player receives for a particular outcome of a game. We say that the player's goal is to maximize his or her payoff. We should note that the maximum payoff for a player might even be negative, in which case the player wants the least negative (or closest to 0) payoff.</p>
