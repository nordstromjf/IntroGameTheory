<p>Hopefully, you determined that there is not a pure strategy equilibrium for Undercut. Thus, we would like to find a mixed strategy equilibrium. Since this is a \(5 \times 5\) game, we cannot use our graphical solution. We will need to rely on our expected value solution. We want to decide with what probability we should play each number. Let \(a, b, c, d, e\) be the probabilities with which Player 2 plays 1-5, respectively. For example, if Player 1 plays a pure strategy of 2, then the expected value for Player 1, \(E_1(2)\text{,}\) is \(-3a+0b+5c-2d-3e\text{.}\)</p>
