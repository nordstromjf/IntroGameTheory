<p>The algebraic method for solving the system of equations (finding the \(x\) and \(y\) values that satisfy both equations) is called <em class="emphasis">row reduction</em>. It is based on the <em class="emphasis">elimination method</em> that you may have seen in a precalculus or college algebra course. We won't go through the algebra here, as we really don't need it. Since our goal is to be able to easily solve larger systems of equations, we will rely on technology to do the algebra.</p>
