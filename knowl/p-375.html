<p>See if you can determine how often Player 1 should play each row, and how often Player 2 should play each column. Try testing your proposed strategy (you may be able to use a variation on the dice as we saw in <a knowl="./knowl/E_RPSdice.html" knowl-id="xref-E_RPSdice" alt="Exercise 3.1.16 " title="Exercise 3.1.16 ">Exercise 3.1.16</a>). Write up any conjectured strategies and the results from playing the game with your strategy. Do you think you have come up with the best strategy? Explain.</p>
