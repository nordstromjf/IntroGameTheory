<p>Given a standard deck of playing cards, what is the probability of drawing a heart?</p>
<p><em class="emphasis">Answer:</em> You might say since there are four suits, and one of the suits is hearts, you have a probability of \(\frac{1}{4}\text{.}\) You'd be correct, but be careful with this reasoning. This works because each suit has the same number of cards, so each suit is <em class="emphasis">equally likely</em>. Another way the calculate the probability is to count the number of hearts (13) divided by the number of cards (52). Thus, we get a probability of \(\frac{13}{52}=\frac{1}{4}=0.25\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_Probability.html#E_drawheart">in-context</a></span>
