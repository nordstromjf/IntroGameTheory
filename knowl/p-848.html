<p>Some possible strategies: </p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Strategy: <dfn class="terminology">Defection.</dfn> Your strategy is to <em class="emphasis">always</em> choose DEFECT (D).</p></li>
<li><p>Strategy: <dfn class="terminology">Cooperation.</dfn> Your strategy is to <em class="emphasis">always</em> choose COOPERATE (C).</p></li>
<li><p>Strategy: <dfn class="terminology">Tit for Tat.</dfn> Your strategy is to play whatever your opponent just played. Your first move is to COOPERATE (C), but then you need to repeat your opponent's last move.</p></li>
<li><p>Strategy: <dfn class="terminology">Tit for Two Tats.</dfn> Your strategy is to COOPERATE (C) unless your opponent DEFECTS twice in a row. After two D's you respond with D.</p></li>
<li><p>Strategy: <dfn class="terminology">Random (1/2, 1/2).</dfn> Your strategy is to COOPERATE (C) randomly 50% of the time and DEFECT (D) 50% of the time. [Note: it will be hard to be truly random, but try to play each option approximately the same amount.]</p></li>
<li><p>Strategy: <dfn class="terminology">Random (3/4, 1/4).</dfn> Your strategy is to COOPERATE (C) randomly 75% of the time and DEFECT (D) 25% of the time. [Note: it will be hard to be truly random, but try to play C more often than D.]</p></li>
<li><p>Strategy: <dfn class="terminology">Random (1/4, 3/4).</dfn> Your strategy is to COOPERATE (C) randomly 25% of the time and DEFECT (D) 75% of the time. [Note: it will be hard to be truly random, but try to play D more often than C.]</p></li>
<li><p>Strategy: <dfn class="terminology">Tit for Tat with Occasional Surprise D.</dfn> Your strategy is to play whatever your opponent just played. Your first move is to COOPERATE (C), but then you need to repeat your opponent's last move. Occasionally, you will deviate from this strategy by playing D.</p></li>
