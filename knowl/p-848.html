<p>Repeated or Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma has applications to biology and sociology. If you think of higher point totals as “success as a species” in biology or “success of a society” in sociology, we can try to determine which strategies seem the most effective or successful. Individuals do not need the highest point total to be successful, but low point totals will not succeed. Just like grades in a course, you don't need the highest score to pass a class, but very bad scores will fail. In order to model the situation of a society, think about what happens to defectors in a society of cooperators or cooperators in a society of defectors. Who will be able to succeed?</p>
