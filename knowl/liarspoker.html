<p>We begin with a deck of cards which has 50% aces (A) and 50% kings (K). Aces rank higher than kings. Player 1 is dealt one card, face down. Player 1 can look at the card, but does not show the card to Player 2. Player 1 then says “ace” or “king” depending on what his card is. Player 1 can either tell the truth and say what the card is (T), or he can bluff and say that he has a higher ranking card (B). Note that if Player 1 has an ace, he must tell the truth since there are no higher ranking cards. However, if he is dealt a king, he can bluff, by saying he has an ace. If Player 1 says “king” the game ends and both players break even. If Player 1 says “ace” then Player 2 can either call (C) or fold (F). If Player 2 folds, then Player 1 wins $0.50. If Player 2 calls and Player 1 does not have an ace, then Player 2 wins $1. If Player 2 calls and Player 1 does have an ace, then Player 1 wins $1.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_LiarsPoker.html#liarspoker">in-context</a></span>
