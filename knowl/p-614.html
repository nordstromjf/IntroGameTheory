<p>Most likely, you said that someone will win the game if they have the most points. In fact, we probably don't care if the final score is 10-12 or 110-112. In either case, Player 2 wins. Since we will play this game several times, we do care about the point difference. For example, a score of 5-1 would be better for Player 1 than 5-3. So let's think about the game in terms of the point difference between the players in a given game. This is called the <em class="emphasis">net gain</em>. For example, with score of 5-1, Player 1 would have a net gain of 4.</p>
