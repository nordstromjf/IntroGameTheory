<body><article class="exercise exercise-like"><p>Let's check our prediction. Using a die, let 1 and 2 represent ROCK, 3 and 4 represent PAPER, and 5 and 6 represent SCISSORS. Play the game 20 times with someone in class where each player rolls to determine the choice of ROCK, PAPER, or SCISSORS. Keep track of the strategy pairs and payoffs. What was the total payoff for each player? (At this point, if you still feel that you have a better strategy, try your strategy against the random oneâ€“ see what happens!)</p></article></body>
