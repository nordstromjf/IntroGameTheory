<p>Let's start with the \(2 \times 2\) case. We will use a <em class="emphasis">proof by contradiction</em>. We will assume the theorem is false and show that we get a logical contradiction. Once we reach a logical contradiction (a statement that is both true and false), we can conclude we were wrong to assume the theorem was false; hence, the theorem must be true. Make sure you are comfortable with the logic of this before moving on.</p>
