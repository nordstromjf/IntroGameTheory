<p>From <a knowl="./knowl/E_eqgood.html" title="Exercise 3.4.11: Equal expected values are better">ExerciseÂ 3.4.11</a> we now know that Player 2 wants \(E_1(H)=E_1(T)\text{,}\) we can use a little algebra to compute the best defensive strategy for Player 2. Remember, we want to assume that Player 1 will always be able to chose the strategy that will be best for her, and thus Player 2 wants to protect himself. Let's find the probabilities with which Player 2 should play H and T.</p>
