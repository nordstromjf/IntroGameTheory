<p>After answering the questions, were you likely to volunteer or unlikely to volunteer? For example, were you likely to be the one to call the power company or get eaten by sharks, or were you generally hoping someone else would do it? If it depended on the situation, explain under what circumstances you were likely to volunteer.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="VDexperiment.html#exercise-239">in-context</a></span>
