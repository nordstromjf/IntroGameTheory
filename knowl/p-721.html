<p>Of course, your hope is to be the only defector, thus really cleaning up: with 19 C-ers, you'll get 95 points, and they'll each get 18 times 3, namely 54 points! But why am I doing the multiplication or any of this figuring for you? You've been studying game theory. So have all of you! You are all equally versed in game theory and understand about making rational choices. Therefore, I hardly need to tell you that you are to make what you consider to be your maximally rational choice. In particular, feelings of morality, guilt, apathy, and so on, are to be disregarded. Reasoning alone (of course including reasoning about others' reasoning) should be the basis of your decision.</p>
