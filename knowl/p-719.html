<p>By the way, I should make it clear that in making your choice, you should not aim to be the winner, but simply to get as many points for yourself as possible. Thus you should be happier to get 30 points (as a result of saying “C” along with 10 others, even though the 9 D-sayers get more than you) than to get 19 points (by saying “D” along with everybody else, so nobody “beats” you).</p>
