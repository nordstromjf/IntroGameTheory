<p>You may have had an idea about the best way to play Rock-Paper-Scissors before working through this section, but how can we find solutions to other games, such as the one in <a knowl="./knowl/E_smallrepeatstrat.html" knowl-id="xref-E_smallrepeatstrat" alt="Exercise 3.1.20 " title="Exercise 3.1.20 ">Exercise 3.1.20</a>? We don't want to just use a “guess and check” method. Especially since there are infinitely many possible mixed strategies to try! The rest of the chapter will develop mathematical methods for solving repeated games with no equilibrium point.</p>
