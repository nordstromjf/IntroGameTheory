<p>Hopefully, you are beginning to see some of the challenges for analyzing non-zero-sum games. We know there are equilibrium points in Battle of the Sexes, but even rational play may not result in an equilibrium. For the remainder of this section, let's assume that players are <em class="emphasis">not</em> allowed to communicate about strategy prior to play. Such games are called <em class="emphasis">non-cooperative</em> games. Before moving on, let's try to find the maximin strategies for our players using the graphical method, as we did with zero-sum games.</p>
