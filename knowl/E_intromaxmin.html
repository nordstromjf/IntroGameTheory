<p>Assume you are Player 1, and you are playing against this “infinitely smart” Player 2. Consider the game in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/T_domstratpractice1.html" title="Table 2.2.17: Payoff matrix for Exercise 2.2.16.">Table 2.2.17</a>. If you pick row A, what will Player 2 do? Player 2 will pick column X or Y. Try this for each of the rows. Which row is your best choice? If you pick A, you will get \(0\text{;}\) if you pick B, you will get \(-2\text{;}\) if you pick C, you will get \(1\text{;}\) and if you pick D you will get \(-2\text{.}\) Thus, your best choice is to choose C and get \(1\text{.}\) Now assume you are Player 2, and Player 1 is “infinitely smart.” Which column is your best choice? If you pick W, Player 1 will get \(1\) (you will get \(-1\)); if you pick X, Player 1 will get \(1\text{;}\) if you pick Y, Player 1 will get \(1\text{;}\) and if you pick Z, you will get \(10\text{.}\) Thus, you can choose W, X, or Y (since you want Player 1 to win the least) and get \(-1\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_DominatedStrategies.html#E_intromaxmin">in-context</a></span>
