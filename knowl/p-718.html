<p>Each member of the class secretly chooses a single letter: “C” or “D,” standing for “cooperate” or “defect.” This will be used as your strategy choice in the following game with each of the other players in the class. Here is how it works for each pair of players: if they both cooperate, they get each get 3 points. If they both defect, they each get 1 point. If one cooperates and one defects, the cooperator gets nothing, but the defector gets 5 points. Your one choice of “C” or “D” will be used to play the game with all the other players in the class.</p>
