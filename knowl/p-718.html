<p>Thus, if everyone chooses “C,” everyone will get 3 points per person (not counting yourself). If everyone chooses “D,” everyone will get 1 point per person (not counting yourself). You can't lose! And of course, anyone chooses “D” will get at least as much as everyone else will. If, for example in a class of 20 poeple, 11 people choose “C” and 9 choose “D,” then the 11 C-ers will get 3 points apiece from the other C-ers (making 30 points), and zero from the D-ers. So C-ers will get 30 points each. The D-ers, by contrast, will pick up 5 points apiece from each of the C-ers, making 55 points, and 1 point from each of the other D-ers, making 8 points, for a grand total of 63 points. No matter what the distribution is, D-ers always do better than C-ers. Of course, the more C-ers there are, the better everyone will do!</p>
