<p>This text is primarily for use in a college-level quantitative reasoning course. It can also be used for an introductory course in game theory for the social sciences. It approaches the subject matter through an inquiry-based format.  Most of the topics can be introduced by providing the students with the activity to work through during class, followed by a discussion. Almost all of the activities are intended to work through the concepts without additional lecture or introduction. Students with even a rudimentary background in algebra will find the material accessible. Any necessary mathematical background can be introduced as needed.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="preface-1.html#Use">in-context</a></span>
