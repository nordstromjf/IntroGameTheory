<p>Now suppose the ace of spades is missing from the deck. What is the probability of drawing a heart?</p>
<p><em class="emphasis">Answer:</em> As before, there are still four suits in the deck, so it might be tempting to say the probability is still \(\frac{1}{4}\text{.}\) But we'd be wrong! Each suit is no longer equally likely since, it is slightly <em class="emphasis">less</em> likely that we draw a spade. Each individual card is still equally likely, though. So now</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
P(\mbox{drawing a heart} )= \frac{\mbox{number of hearts} }{\mbox{number of cards} }=\frac{13}{51}= 0.255.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>As you can see, it is now slightly more likely that we draw a heart if the ace of spades is removed from the deck.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_Probability.html#E_takeawayspade">in-context</a></span>
