</h6>
<p>Just from playing Undercut several times, can you suggest a strategy for Player 1? What about for Player 2? For example, what number(s) should you play most often/ least often, or does it matter? Are there numbers you should never play? Does this game seem fair, or does one of the players seem to have an advantage? Explain your answers.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_Undercut.html#E_Uguessstrat">in-context</a></span>
