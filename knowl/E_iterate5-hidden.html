<body><article class="exercise exercise-like"><p>Suppose both players initially decide to use the minimax/ maximin strategy in the game in <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/T_domstratpractice5.html" title="Table 2.2.31: Payoff matrix for Exercise 2.2.30.">Table 2.2.31</a>. Is Player 1 better off choosing a different strategy? If Player 2 guesses a change, is Player 2 better off changing strategies? Continue this line of reasoning for several iterations. What strategies do each of the players choose? Is at least one player always better off switching strategies? Can we conclude that the maximin/ minimax strategy does not lead to an equilibrium pair?</p></article></body>
