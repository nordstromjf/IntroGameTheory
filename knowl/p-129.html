<p>You determined that Player 2 should choose to play Y, and thus, Player 1 should play B (i.e., we have the strategy pair [B, Y]). Why is this an equilibrium pair? If Player 2 plays Y, does Player 1 have any reason to change to strategy A? No, she would lose 10 instead of 1! If Player 1 plays B, does Player 2 have any reason to change to strategy X? No, she would gain 0 instead of 1! Thus neither player benefits from changing strategy, and so we say [B, Y] is an equilibrium pair.</p>
