<p>Assume Player 1 only plays \(A\text{.}\)</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>If Player 2 only plays \(C\text{,}\) what is the payoff to Player 1? Recall we called this \(m\text{.}\) What is the probability that Player 2 plays \(D\text{?}\) Recall we called this \(p\text{.}\) On your graph, plot the point (\(p\text{,}\) \(m\)).</p></li>
<li><p>If Player 2 plays only \(D\text{,}\) find \(m\) and \(p\text{.}\) Plot \((p, m)\) on the graph.</p></li>
<li><p>Now sketch the line through your two points. This line represents Player 1's pure strategy \(A\) and the expected payoff (to Player 1) for Player 2's mixed strategies. Label it \(A\text{.}\)</p></li>
