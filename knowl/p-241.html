<p>A standard roulette wheel has 38 numbered slots for a small ball to land in: 36 are marked from 1 to 36, with half of those black and half red; two green slots are numbered 0 and 00. An allowable bet is to bet on either red of black. This bet is an even money bet, which means if you win you receive twice what you bet. Many people think that betting black or red is a fair game. What is the expected value of betting $1000 on red? Is this a fair game? Explain.</p>
