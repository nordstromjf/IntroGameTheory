You agree to send the money at the same time that the seller agrees to send the book. Then we can think of Cooperating as each of you sending money/ book, and Defecting as not sending money/ book. Why might a player Cooperate? Why might a player Defect?</p></article></div>

<p id="p-826">It is possible that your answers to the above questions depended on the context, so let's go back to just thinking about the game as a simple matrix game. Think about how you played the Class-wide Prisoner's Dilemma, but now think about repeating the game several times with the same player. Do you think your strategy would change? Remember, if we repeat the game we are not restricted to playing a pure strategy.</p>

<p id="p-848">Repeated or Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma has applications to biology and sociology. If you think of higher point totals as “success as a species” in biology or “success of a society” in sociology, we can try to determine which strategies seem the most effective or successful. Individuals do not need the highest point total to be successful, but low point totals will not succeed. Just like grades in a course, you don't need the highest score to pass a class, but very bad scores will fail. In order to model the situation of a society, think about what happens to defectors in a society of cooperators or cooperators in a society of defectors. Who will be able to succeed?</p>

<p id="p-853">The TIT-FOR-TAT strategy is particularly interesting in an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. It has a few special characteristics that lead to success. First it is <em class="emphasis">responsive</em> in that it responds to the strategy of the other player. If the other player is cooperating, the TIT-FOR-TAT strategy will be able to gain the 3 points on each round. If the other player is defecting, it will defect so as to not keep getting the sucker's payoff of 0. The random strategies and pure strategies, for example, are not responsive. They do not respond to how the other player is playing. Chances are when you played in the tournament, you wanted to be able to adapt your strategy to respond to how your opponent was playing.</p>
<p id="p-854">The TIT-FOR-TAT strategy is also <em class="emphasis">nice</em> in that it starts by cooperating. If it meets another cooperator it will continue to cooperate. If the opponent at some point begins cooperating, it will, too. However, it is also <em class="emphasis">unexploitable</em>. This means that a defector cannot take advantage of the “niceness.” It “punishes” any defection with an in-kind defection.</p>
<p id="p-855">The TIT-FOR-TAT behavior has been observed in some animal populations, but you also might be able to think of situations in your own life where you or your friends have employed such a strategy with each other! Has it been effective for you?</p></section></div></main>
