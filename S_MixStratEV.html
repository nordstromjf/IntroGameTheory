<p id="p-490">In this section, we will use the idea of expected value to find the equilibrium mixed strategies for repeated two-person zero-sum games.</p>
<p id="p-491">One of the significant drawbacks of the graphical solution from the previous sections is that it can only solve 2 X 2 matrix games. If each player has 3 options, we would need to graph in three dimensions. Technically this is possible, but rather complicated. If each player has more than 3 options, since we can't graph in four or more dimensions, we are at a complete loss. So we need to think about an alternate way to solve for the mixed strategies. Although we will begin with 2 X 2 games, this method will easily generalize to larger games.</p>

<p id="p-497">We could use our previous graphical method to determine the expected value of the game (you might quickly try this just to verify your prediction). However, as we have noted, a major drawback of the graphical solution is that if our players have 3 (or more) options, then we would need to graph an equation in 3 (or more!) variables; which, I hope you agree, we don't want to do. Although we will continue to focus on \(2 \times 2\) games, we will develop a new method which can more easily be used to solve to larger games.</p>
<p id="p-498">We will need a little notation. Let</p>
\begin{align*}
P_1(H) \amp  = \mbox{ the probability that Player 1 plays H; }\\
P_1(T) \amp  = \mbox{ the probability that Player 1 plays T;}\\
P_2(H) \amp  = \mbox{ the probability that Player 2 plays H; }\\
P_2(T) \amp  = \mbox{ the probability that Player 2 plays T.}
\end{align*}
<p>Also, we will let \(E_1(H)\) be the expected value for Player 1 playing pure strategy H against a given strategy for Player 2. Similarly, \(E_2(H)\) will be Player 2's expected value for playing pure strategy H.</p>

<p id="p-513">So in general, to solve for Player 2's strategy, we want to write an equation for each of Player 1's pure strategy expected values in terms of Player 2's probabilities. For example, \(E_1(H)\) and \(E_1(T)\) in terms of variables \(P_2(H)\) and \(P_2(T)\text{.}\) We then set the expected values equal to each other. We now have an equation just in terms of Player 2's probabilities.</p>
<p id="p-514">In order to solve for the probabilities, we also need to use the fact that Player 2's probabilities sum to 1. For example, \(P_2(H)+P_2(T)=1\text{.}\) For a \(2 \times 2\) game, you now have 2 equations with 2 unknowns (\(P_2(H)\) and \(P_2(T)\)). Use an algebraic method such as substitution or elimination to solve the system of equations.</p>

But how can we find the value of the game? For Player 2, we assumed \(E_1(H)=E_1(T)\text{.}\) In other words, we found the situation in which Player 1's expected value is the same no matter which pure strategy she plays. Thus, Player 1 is <em class="emphasis">indifferent</em> to which pure strategy she plays. If she were not indifferent, then she would play the strategy with a higher expected value. But, as we saw, this would be bad for Player 2. So Player 1 can assume that Player 2 will play the equilibrium mixed strategy. Thus, as long as Player 1 plays a mixed strategy, it doesn't matter whether at any given time, she plays H or T (this is the idea that she is indifferent to them). Hence, the expected value of the game for Player 1 is the same as \(E_1(H)\text{,}\) which is the same as \(E_1(T)\text{.}\) Similarly, we find that the expected value of the game for Player 2 is \(E_2(H)\) (or \(E_2(T)\)). This is a pretty complicated idea. You may need to think about it for a while. In the meantime, use the probabilities you found for each player and the equations for \(E_1(H)\) and  \(E_2(H)\) to find the value of the game for each player.</p>

We just have more equations. Use the expected value method to find the equilibrium mixed strategy for Rock-Paper-Scissors for Player 2. (Hint: You will need to set \(E_1(R)=E_1(P)\) and \(E_1(P)=E_1(S)\text{;}\) solve for \(P_2(R), P_2(P), P_2(S)\text{;}\) etc. It should be very similar to what you did for Matching Pennies, but there will be three equations and three unknowns.)</p></article></div>
